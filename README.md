# Project Atlas - AI-Powered Web Accessibility Extension

## Overview

Project Atlas is a Chrome extension designed to help screen reader users quickly understand webpage structure and layout through AI-generated audio summaries.

## Features 🎯

* One-Click Analysis: Instantly analyze any webpage's structure
* 🤖 AI-Powered Summaries: Uses Google Gemini to generate concise, helpful summaries
* 🔊 Audio Output: Automatically speaks summaries using built-in text-to-speech
* ♿ Accessibility First: Built specifically for screen reader users
* 🔒 Privacy Focused: Your API key is stored securely and never shared

## Installation

### Step 1: Get a Google Gemini API Key

* Visit Google AI Studio
* Sign in with your Google account
* Click "Create API Key"
* Copy the generated key

### Step 2: Install the Extension

* Download or clone this repository
* Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
* Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right corner)
* Click "Load unpacked"
* Listen to the audio summary describing the page's structure

## What Gets Analyzed

The extension extracts and analyzes:

* **Page Title:** The main title of the webpage
* **Headings:** All H1-H6 headings to understand content hierarchy
* **Landmarks:** HTML5 semantic elements (header, nav, main, footer, etc.)
* **ARIA Roles:** Accessibility roles for better screen reader compatibility
* **Interactive Elements:** Count of links, buttons, forms, and inputs
* **Meta Information:** Language, description, and accessibility features

### Example Output

> "You are on a Wikipedia page titled 'Roman Empire'. The page has a main navigation bar with links to different sections. The primary content area contains multiple sections including History, Government, and Military. There are 342 links throughout the page and a search form in the header."

## Architecture Overview

### Three-Component Design

#### Popup Script (popup.js)

* User interface trigger
* Handles button clicks and visual feedback
* Manages settings panel for API key configuration
* Displays loading, success, and error states

#### Content Script (content.js)

* Runs on every webpage
* Parses the DOM to extract semantic structure
* Creates clean JSON representation of page layout
* Sends structured data to background script

#### Background Script (background.js)

* Service worker that orchestrates the entire process
* Securely manages API key storage
* Constructs prompts for AI analysis
* Makes API calls to Google Gemini
* Handles text-to-speech output
* Manages error handling and user feedback

### Data Flow

## Technical Details

### DOM Parsing Strategy

The content script prioritizes semantic HTML5 tags and ARIA roles to understand page structure:

* Extracts headings to understand content hierarchy
* Identifies landmarks (nav, main, header, footer)
* Counts interactive elements for navigation complexity
* Detects accessibility features like skip links

### AI Prompt Engineering

The background script uses carefully crafted prompts that:

* Provide context about the user's needs (screen reader user)
* Include structured JSON data about the page
* Request concise, actionable summaries (2-4 sentences)
* Focus on navigation and page purpose

### Error Handling

The extension gracefully handles multiple failure scenarios:

* No API Key: Prompts user to configure settings
* API Errors: Speaks clear error message to user
* Network Failures: Provides helpful troubleshooting guidance
* Unparseable Pages: Detects and reports pages that can't be analyzed

## Browser Compatibility

* ✅ Chrome (Manifest V3)
* ✅ Edge (Chromium-based)
* ⚠️ Other browsers not yet supported

## Privacy & Security

* API keys are stored locally using Chrome's secure storage API
* No data is collected or sent to any server except Google Gemini
* Page content is processed locally; only structured metadata is sent to AI
* Extension requires explicit user action to analyze pages

## Performance Considerations

* DOM parsing is optimized to run quickly even on large pages
* All operations are asynchronous to prevent browser freezing
* API calls include timeout protection (30 seconds)
* TTS can be interrupted if another analysis is started

## Limitations

* Requires a Google Gemini API key (free tier available)
* Cannot analyze pages that don't allow content scripts (chrome://, file://)
* Summaries are limited to 200 tokens for quick responses
* Requires active internet connection

## Future Enhancements (Beyond Phase 1)

* Custom voice selection for TTS
* Adjustable speech rate
* Summary history
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Support for additional AI models
* Offline mode with cached summaries
* Multi-language support

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot analyze this page type"

Some pages don't support content scripts:

* Chrome internal pages (chrome://)
* Browser extension pages
* Local file:// URLs (unless explicitly enabled)

### "API key not configured"

* Click the extension icon
* Click "⚙️ Settings"
* Enter your Gemini API key
* Click "Save Key"

### "Analysis failed"

Check these common issues:

* Verify your API key is correct
* Ensure you have an active internet connection
* Check if you've exceeded your API quota
* Try refreshing the page and analyzing again

### No audio output

* Check your system volume
* Verify Chrome has permission to use audio
* Try clicking "Analyze Page" again
